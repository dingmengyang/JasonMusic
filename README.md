A stage-completed music player for Android


In the fist stage,the player intergrated some functions basically,containing looking for the music files in the SDcard and show them in 
our main interface,and four buttons which used for playing last,playing or pausing,stoping and playing next,though it only work when you 
keep running the application,even you can't light your screen off...


In the second stage,I switched the playing function from activity to service,which makes the app keeps playing when user leave the main interface...

Add a seekbar for controlling the progress of playing status,also a menu for some functions,like changing the theme resources...

In this section,I completed the desktop widget and notification functions to control our player which are aimed at making the player more attractive,via that I found a little bugs,such as canceling the notification leads to the widget not initialized,besids that,the notification didn't show the music name and the singer name...maybe in the coming days someone will help them...
